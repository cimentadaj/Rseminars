  Output: Hello and welcome to the third lesson of the 3rd RonR! seminar. On this lesson
        we will cover the basics of descriptive statistics, frequency tables and correlation,
        the main functions for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
        
- Class: text
  Output: This lesson is not about statistics nor it will explain what each function does in detail.
    The purpose is to show you that R has these standard functions available and that you can use
    them whenever you want. In case you already know what they mean, then they will prove handy.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: First, let's read the data. There's a string vector called txt_file in your workspace
    that has the link to a .txt dataset. Read it and give it the name dati. Do whatever you have
    to do to read it, even if it means inspecting the data directly by going to the link. Hint;
    while reading the data, change the three column names to c('age', 'X2014', 'X2013').
  CorrectAnswer: dati <- read.table(txt_file, header = T, col.names = c("age", "X2014", "X2013"), sep = " ")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr=('dati <- read.table(txt_file, header = T, col.names = c("age", "X2014", "X2013"), sep = " ")')
  Hint: Okay, so there are two difficulties. If you looked at the table, there's three columns
    but only two column names. You have to specify (in read.table) that the first row is the
    column names and provide new names. Use ?read.table to find the arguments and remember
    to specify the 'sep' argument!
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Have a look at the first few rows of dati.
  CorrectAnswer: head(dati)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='head(dati)')
  Hint: Type head(dati)
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now let's have a look at the 'tail' of the dataset. Try it
  CorrectAnswer: tail(dati)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='tail(dati)')
  Hint: Type tail(dati)
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use dim() with dati.
  CorrectAnswer: dim(dati)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='dim(dati)')
  Hint: Type dim(dati)

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What's the oldest age in the dataset?
  AnswerChoices: 33; 35; 42; 44; 40; we don't have that information
  CorrectAnswer: 35
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= '35')

# YOu left here trying out the mult_question only with the numbers, to see if it worked
# but you found out that the reading the data question is not working properly. In fact,
# its too long, try and shorten it or cut it in different questions.

# Teach the cut() function.
  
- Class: text
  Output: It's always a good habit to inspect your dataset, specially when you're reading a csv, text
        or other format file. Just to make sure that it was read without any problems.
        
- Class: text
  Output: R has some standard functions to calculate descriptive statistics. To name a few, mean is
        mean(), the standard deviation is sd(), the variance is var() and the median is median().

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Let's calculate the mean of the variable maxgrip. If I typed mean(dati), what 
        would I get?
  AnswerChoices: The mean of dati; The mean of maxgrip; An error;
  CorrectAnswer: An error
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'An error')
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Alright, that was a trick question. Remember that dati is a data frame! It contains several columns
        and many rows. How would you calculate the mean of a data frame? The correct expression
        would be to calculate the mean of maxgrip using the $ operator from the dataframe dati. Try it
        yourself.
  CorrectAnswer: mean(dati$maxgrip)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='mean(dati$maxgrip)')
  Hint: dati$maxgrip is the variable maxgrip, so simply type mean(dati$maxgrip)
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Using the sd() function calculate the standard deviation of maxgrip
  CorrectAnswer: sd(dati$maxgrip)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='sd(dati$maxgrip)')
  Hint: Type sd(dati$maxgrip)
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Do exactly the same with var() function to calculate the variance of maxgrip.
  CorrectAnswer: var(dati$maxgrip)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='var(dati$maxgrip)')
  Hint: Type var(dati$maxgrip)
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Suppose we want to compare the result of the mean() function with the median() function. Calculate
        the median() of maxgrip.
  CorrectAnswer: median(dati$maxgrip)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='median(dati$maxgrip)')
  Hint: Type median(dati$maxgrip)
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What about quantiles? They're pretty easy to get with the quantile function. Without me explaining it,
        try to use the quantile() function on our maxgrip variable.
  CorrectAnswer: quantile(dati$maxgrip)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='quantile(dati$maxgrip)')
  Hint: Type quantile(dati$maxgrip)
  
- Class: text
  Output: That's nice! But what if we wanted a specific quantile? Then we specify it as a second argument
        like here quantile(dati$maxgrip, 0.65). That would give us the value of the 65th quantile.
        
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: As for frequency tables, R has the table() function. It has as many arguments as you want to
        specify. Let's imagine we want to see the number of people within a country. Type table(dati$country)
  CorrectAnswer: table(dati$country)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='table(dati$country)')
  Hint: Type table(dati$country)
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's look at the number of males and females within each country. Take the last table
        add a comma and add the sex variable from the dati dataframe. This time
        save the table to an object named ourtable using the <- operator.
  CorrectAnswer: ourtable <- table(dati$country, dati$sex)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='ourtable <- table(dati$country, dati$sex)')
  Hint: Type ourtable <- table(dati$country, dati$sex). This will give you a two way table.

- Class: text
  Output: We can add as many other variables as you want by simply putting a comma and adding another
        variable. You could create 3, 4, 5 way tables if you want.
        
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: However what many people are after when computing frequencies is not the number of people in
    these tables but the proportion or percentage. We can use the prop.table() function, with our
    table object and specify the margin argumen to 1 to get the percentages by row. Try it with this
    expression prop.table(x=ourtable,margin=1)
  CorrectAnswer: prop.table(x=ourtable,margin=1)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='prop.table(x=ourtable,margin=1)')
  Hint: Type prop.table(x=ourtable,margin=1)
  
- Class: text
  Output: You could get the column percentages by changing the 1 for a 2 in the margin argument.
  
- Class: text
  Output: You can also get the relative frequencies dividing the table by the total amount of observations.
    A smart way of doing this would be to write ourtable / sum(ourtable). You can read it as
    each number in our table divided by the sum of all the numbers of our table -- the total number
    of observations.
    
- Class: text
  Output: A cool thing you can do with R is divide a continuous variable into groups
    for exploratory purposes. The cut() function cuts a continuous variable into a desired number
    groups.
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's see an example. We have our maxgrip variable which is a continuous variable. Type
        table(dati$maxgrip) to see the outcome.
  CorrectAnswer: table(dati$maxgrip)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='table(dati$maxgrip)')
  Hint: Type table(dati$maxgrip)
  
- Class: text
  Output: That's neither a nice output nor an informative table. Let's make it better with
    the cut function. maxgrip goes from 0 to 42, so let's cut it in groups of 5. So the amount of
    people between 0-5, 5-10, and so on...

- Class: text
  Output: Let's read the expression before seeing it. I want R to cut dati$maxgrip from 0
    to 45 into chunks of 5. As an additional argument, we want R to include 0, which is the LOWEST
    number in our numeric variable.
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The corresponding expression would be this cut.maxgrip <- cut(dati$maxgrip, breaks=seq(0, 45, by= 5),
        include.lowest=TRUE) . Before typing it down, read it carefully and try to understand it.
  CorrectAnswer: cut.maxgrip <- cut(dati$maxgrip, breaks=seq(0, 45, by= 5),include.lowest=TRUE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='cut.maxgrip <- cut(dati$maxgrip, breaks=seq(0, 45, by= 5),include.lowest=TRUE)')
  Hint: Type cut.maxgrip <- cut(dati$maxgrip, breaks=seq(0, 45, by= 5),include.lowest=TRUE)
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The remaining part is easy, write down table() with the cut.maxgrip object inside.
  CorrectAnswer: table(cut.maxgrip)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='table(cut.maxgrip)')
  Hint: Type table(cut.maxgrip)
        
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Cool, eh? Finally, for those of you which use correlation, the function is cor(). Want to
    calculate the correlation between dati$height and dati$weight? cor(dati$height,dati$weight)
    will do the job. Write it down.
  CorrectAnswer: cor(dati$height, dati$weight)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='cor(dati$height, dati$weight)')
  Hint: Type cor(dati$height, dati$weight)
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Ah! Of course! If the correlation has missing values, then you can't calculate the correlation. Take the same expression
      and add the argument use = "complete.obs" to your function. It is simply saying = use only complete observations
  CorrectAnswer: cor(dati$height, dati$weight, use = "complete.obs")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='cor(dati$height, dati$weight, use = "complete.obs")')
  Hint: Type cor(dati$height, dati$weight, use = "complete.obs")
  
- Class: text
  Output: I hope all of this was useful! It certainly is to me.
