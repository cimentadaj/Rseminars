First presentation:

Delete? If not, update all links to be within the repo and also the scripts for installing packages.

Overall:
- Find a solution for first lesson because it’s getting install with the swirl course
- Deleted course installation for every single course. Install every course
in the second seminar. Write an explanation for each course that it was installed
previously and redirect to installation

- RECHECK the above but I think it’s fixed!
