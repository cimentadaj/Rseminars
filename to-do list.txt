Overall:
- Find a solution for first lesson because itâ€™s getting install with the swirl course
- Deleted course installation for every single course. Install every course
in the second seminar. Write an explanation for each course that it was installed
previously and redirect to installation

Second seminar:
- Create separate lesson for factors

Third seminar:
- Create challange as last lesson
- Updated README that includes installation and links to second seminar README.
