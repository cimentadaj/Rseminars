Overall:
- Find a solution for first lesson because it’s getting install with the swirl course
- Deleted course installation for every single course. Install every course
in the second seminar. Write an explanation for each course that it was installed
previously and redirect to installation

Second seminar:
- Create separate lesson for factors

Third seminar:
- Create challange as last lesson

Fourth seminar:
- Pretty much rewrite everything

Fifth seminar:
- Should you teach this lesson? Hmm it’s a bit difficult to teach if statements and loops in this interactive fashion. Perhaps with the ‘script’ type of question by showing excuting from the script rather than from console.
