First presentation:

Delete? If not, update all links to be within the repo and also the scripts for installing packages.

Overall:
- Find a solution for first lesson because it’s getting install with the swirl course
- Deleted course installation for every single course. Install every course
in the second seminar. Write an explanation for each course that it was installed
previously and redirect to installation

- RECHECK the above but I think it’s fixed!

Second seminar:
- Create separate lesson for factors

Third seminar:
- Create challange as last lesson

Fourth seminar:
- Pretty much rewrite everything

Fifth seminar:
- Should you teach this lesson? Hmm it’s a bit difficult to teach if statements and loops in this interactive fashion. Perhaps with the ‘script’ type of question by showing excuting from the script rather than from console.
