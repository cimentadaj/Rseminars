- Class: text
  Output: Hello! Welcome to our lesson on matrices and lists. Matrices are widely used in mathematics and
    algebra and are really useful in computer science. In this lesson we'll learn how to use matrices
    in R and how characteristics they have.
    
- Class: text
  Output: First off, what is a matrix? A matrix is simply a rectangular shaped data set usually
    filled with numbers. So, if you've used Excel or any other spreadsheet program you are in fact
    dealing with matrix-like objects, although you don't name them like that.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: A matrix is a "dataset" with "n" number of rows and "n" number of columns. I've taken the
    liberty of creating a matrix so you can check it our for yourself. Type ourmatrix.
  CorrectAnswer: ourmatrix
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='ourmatrix')
  Hint: Type ourmatrix
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: See? There's no need to feel intimidated by matrices. They’re simply a "dataset". Here, this
    matrix has 3 rows and 3 columns. How do we create matrices? Well there's the function "matrix()".
    Type ?matrix() and have a look at the description to your right to see if you understand how it works.
  CorrectAnswer: ?matrix()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='?matrix()')
  Hint: Type ?matrix()
  
- Class: text
  Output: C'mon, have a look! :)
  
- Class: text
  Output: 'Here is how it works: matrix(data,nrow,ncol). The matrix you saw earlier was created with
    this expression: matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, ncol = 3). In this case, the first argument means from the number
    1 to the number 9, distributed in 3 rows and 3 columns (since you’ve already seen generating sequences
    you should have an idea about this).'
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now it’s your turn. Create a matrix that contains from the numbers 1 to 12, distributed in 4
    rows and 3 columns.
  CorrectAnswer: any_of_exprs("matrix(1:12, nrow=4,ncol=3)", "matrix(1:12,4,3)")
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs("matrix(1:12, nrow=4,ncol=3)", "matrix(1:12,4,3)")
  Hint: 'Remember that matrix syntax: matrix(vector, number of rows, number of columns)'
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Matrices not only accept numeric vectors but also logical or character vectors.
    As we saw in the past lessons, you can create a vector with the c() function. Try to create a matrix
    which contains a logical vector of length 4 where the first two observations are TRUE and the
    remaining two are FALSE. In addition, the matrix should have two rows and two columns.
  CorrectAnswer: any_of_exprs("matrix(c(TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE),2,2)", "matrix(c(T,T,F,F),2,2)")
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs("matrix(c(TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE),2,2)", "matrix(c(T,T,F,F),2,2)")
  Hint: 'If the matrix needs to have a logical vector of length 4 that contains two TRUEs and two FALSEs,
    then the vector would look like this: c(TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE). Add that to your matrix and specify
    the number of rows and columns.'
  
- Class: text
  Output: Now that you've understood how to create matrices, it’s important to know how to subset matrices.
    I can’t stress this enough but it’s really important that you understand this process clearly
    since it is the backbone of subsetting and filtering objects in R.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let’s take as an example the existing matrix called "ourmatrix". Type ourmatrix again.
  CorrectAnswer: ourmatrix
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr= "ourmatrix")
  Hint: Type ourmatrix
  
- Class: text
  Output: As you can see, each row and column has a number assigned. So the 1st column has a number 1,
    the 2nd a number 2, and so on. The same pattern is visible for rows. But if you have closer look,
    the name of the 1st column is [, 1], the name of the 2nd column is [, 2] and the name of the 3rd
    column is [, 3]. For rows it is exactly the same but with the number BEFORE the comma(so [1,],
    [2,] and [3,]).
    
- Class: text
  Output: By default, whenever you don't specify any row/column numbers, R subsets all rows/columns.
    For example, ourmatrix[, 3] will return all rows (because none were specified) for the third
    column. Conversely, ourmatrix[1, ] will return the first row for all columns (because no columns
    were specified). Lastly, ourmatrix[2, 2:3] will return the second row for the second and third
    column.
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: That is how subsetting works. The number before the comma represent the row number and
    after the comma the column number. Using ourmatrix, subset the first column for all rows.
  CorrectAnswer: ourmatrix[,1]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr= "ourmatrix[,1]")
  Hint: Type ourmatrix[,1]
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, try subsetting all columns only for the 3rd row.
  CorrectAnswer: ourmatrix[3,]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr= "ourmatrix[3,]")
  Hint: If ourmatrix[,1] isolates the 1st column, then isolating the 3rd row would be the same but with 3 before the comma.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What about subsetting the 3rd row, only for the 2nd column?
  CorrectAnswer: ourmatrix[3,2]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr= "ourmatrix[3,2]")
  Hint: Well, that's easy! If outmatrix[3,] gives the 3rd row and ourmatrix[,2] the 2nd column, then combining
    both things will give the 3rd row for the 2nd column.
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's suppose for a minute that ourmatrix is a dataset you collected where
    each row is a person you interviewed and each column is a question you asked them.
    Subset the the 1st and 3rd person only on their 2nd question and save it with the name my_matrix.
  CorrectAnswer: my_matrix <- ourmatrix[c(1,3),2]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="my_matrix <- ourmatrix[c(1,3),2]")
  Hint: Remember that c() wil concatenate any two numbers. To select the 1st and 3rd observation you need to
    type c(1,3).
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Check the contents of my_matrix.
  CorrectAnswer: my_matrix
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="my_matrix")
  Hint: Type the name of my_matrix to see the inner contents.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Have you noticed something different from all of your results above? If you hadn't, then
    subsetting a matrix returns a vector, not a matrix! Let's confirm this. Using your previous
    my_matrix, take the class() to see what it is.
  CorrectAnswer: class(my_matrix)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="class(my_matrix)")
  Hint: class() returns the R class of the object in the first argument. Check the class of my_matrix
    by placing my_matrix as the first argument of class().

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'When subsetting R automatically turns the result into a vector (the type of vector will
    depend on the which elements are in the matrix: numbers, characters, etc..). This might
    be what you wanted..or not. Sometimes you simply want to subset something and get a matrix back.
    We can do that by specifying drop = F like this: ourmatrix[1, , drop = F]. Try it
    yourself.'
  CorrectAnswer: ourmatrix[1, , drop = F]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="ourmatrix[1, , drop = F]")
  Hint: Type ourmatrix[1, , drop = F] to get a matrix back.
  
- Class: text
  Output: Great! It's a matrix.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: One very important thing of matrices is that they can only accept one type of vector.
    A matrix can only be all numeric, all characters, all logicals or all factors. Think about
    what this code will return and then run it matrix(c('character', 1), 2, 2).
  CorrectAnswer: matrix(c('character', 1), 2, 2)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="matrix(c('character', 1), 2, 2)")
  Hint: Type matrix(c('character', 1), 2, 2).

- Class: text
  Output: Think about what R returned..is it what you expected? Why did this happen?
  
- Class: text
  Output: 'Behind the scenes, R accepts only one class within a matrix. It returned a character
    matrix (notice how the 1 is wrapped in ""). By default, R will transform numerics to characters
    where only one class is permitted. Keep this in mind, as you will have to deal with these nuances
    on a daily basis!'

- Class: text
  Output: 'As a final thought, what if we wanted to change the number of the 2nd respondent in his first
    column. How would we go about? Well picture it this way: ourmatrix[2, 1] will return the number we
    want to change. If we know that, then we just have to reassign a new number.
    So ourmatrix[2, 1] <- 4 will change the number of the second respondent in his first column to 4.'
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: That was easy, but I'll take you to the limit. ourmatrix has 3 rows and 3 columns.
    Replace the second row with a sequence from 100 to 102.
  CorrectAnswer: ourmatrix[2, ] <- 100:102
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="ourmatrix[2, ] <- 100:102")
  Hint: Type ourmatrix[2, ] <- 100:102.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Type ourmatrix to see your result
  CorrectAnswer: ourmatrix
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="ourmatrix")
  Hint: Type ourmatrix.
  
- Class: text
  Output: Now that you have a good idea about matrices, let's talk about lists. Lists are a common
    concept in many programming languages. Let's try and understand lists with practical examples. Let's
    think of Santa Claus. If you've been raised in a Western society you should have a good idea of who
    Santa Claus is. If you weren't, then the example is pretty straight forward and you will also understand. 

- Class: text
  Output: Santa Claus had a big bag full of presents, right? Let's assume the bag had three wrapped presents.  

- Class: text
  Output: Each present might contain a similar gift, like three books, or it might contain completely different
    presents. Taking the analogy to R, it is exactly the same. A list(in the Santa case, the bag) will contain
    similar or different R objects(presents, which might be all books or might be all different objects).

- Class: text
  Output: The list function works this way; list(object1, object2, object(n)). The n means that you can
    input as many objects as you want. Let's have a look at this list and try to understand it;
    list(myfirst = 1:10, mysecond = c(TRUE,FALSE), mythird = c("books","toy car")).
    
- Class: text
  Output: This list contains THREE objects separeted by three commas. What is the name of the first
    object? myfirst. What is the name of the third object? mythird. After the equal sign you can
    see the contents of each object and interpret what is the class of each vector.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's dig in on how to access objects within a list. Let's run the same
    list function as before but let's assign it to the the name ourlist. Assign list(myfirst = 1:10,
    mysecond = c(TRUE,FALSE), mythird = c('books','toy car')) to the name ourlist.
  CorrectAnswer: ourlist <- list(list(myfirst = 1:10, mysecond = c(TRUE,FALSE), mythird = c('books','toy car')))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="ourlist <- list(myfirst = 1:10, mysecond = c(TRUE,FALSE), mythird = c('books','toy car'))")
  Hint: Assigning something simply means putting a name followed by the <- sign, so ourlist <-
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Check the class of the ourlist object by typing class(ourlist)
  CorrectAnswer: class(ourlist)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="class(ourlist)")
  Hint: Type class(ourlist)
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now type ourlist to see it's contents.
  CorrectAnswer: ourlist
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="ourlist")
  Hint: Type ourlist
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The 1st object is called $myfirst, the 2nd $mysecond and the 3rd $mythird. Note that the
    $ sign is NOT part of the name, but it is actually a way of SUBSETTING the object. Type ourlist$myfirst
  CorrectAnswer: ourlist$myfirst
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="ourlist$myfirst")
  Hint: Type ourlist$myfirst
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: And now type class(ourlist$myfirst)
  CorrectAnswer: class(ourlist$myfirst)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="class(ourlist$myfirst)")
  Hint: Type class(ourlist$myfirst)
  
- Class: text
  Output: Note that ourlist$myfirst is NOT a list object but a NUMERIC vector. When you use the
    $ sign you are already accessing the object inside the list. So you can actually treat ourlist$myfirst
    as a simple numeric vector. For example, if you wanted to subset the 3rd position of a numeric vector you
    would do it like this; vector[3]. In this case, it would be the same; ourlist$myfirst[3].
  
- Class: text
  Output: Another way of subsetting a list is to use brackets. If we wanted to access the second object
    in the list you could also do it like this; ourlist[2].

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What is the class of ourlist[2]? Type class(ourlist[2])
  CorrectAnswer: class(ourlist[2])
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="class(ourlist[2])")
  Hint: Type class(ourlist[2])
  
- Class: text
  Output: If you thought it was a logical vector, that's a common mistake. When a list object is
    followed by a set of brackets, your subsetting the object but it is still a LIST. If you go back to the
    command ourlist[2] you'll see that the output had $logical on top. Remember, everytime you see the $ sign,
    it means that it's still inside a list.
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: If you wanted to access the specific vector then you need to wrap the number in FOUR brackets.
    ourlist[[2]] should give you what you’re looking for. Check it yourself with the class() function.
  CorrectAnswer: class(ourlist[[2]])
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="class(ourlist[[2]])")
  Hint: Type class(class(ourlist[[2]]))
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: As a last task, if ourlist[[2]] is a VECTOR, then how would you subset its 2nd element? Hint;
    it’s the same way we got the the 3rd element of ourlist$numeric.
  CorrectAnswer: ourlist[[2]][2]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="ourlist[[2]][2]")
  Hint: If ourlist[[2]] is a vector, then to subset a vector we use an ADDITIONAL [] with the number we're
    interested inside the brackets.
  
- Class: text
  Output: That should give you a pretty good idea about what lists are all about. You learned some pretty neat
    stuff today! Now go over  to the next lesson.
