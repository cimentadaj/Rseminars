  Lesson: Vectors and Objects
  Author: Jorge Cimentada and Basilio Moreno
  Type: Standard
  Organization: RECSM, UPF
  Version: 2.2.21
  
- Class: text
  Output: 'Hello and welcome to the second lesson of the course!
    On this session we will introduce the basic building block
    of the R language: vectors'

- Class: text
  Output: 'R operates using different data structures. The simplest such
    structure is the numeric vector, which is a single entity consisting
    of an ordered collection of numbers'
    
- Class: text
  Output: 'You can often think of vectors as variables. Yes, exactly like
    those you have a normal datasets. However, you often treat vectors separately
    from their datasets. Let’s see an example.'
    
- Class: text
  Output: 'To set up a vector named income consisting of five numbers, 10, 5, 3, 6 and 21,
  you would use the R command income <- c(10, 5, 3, 6, 21)'
  
- Class: text
  Output: "If you would’ve wanted only to include one number then you would’ve written
    income <- 10. Whenever you want to put together more than one number you use the c()
    command which stands for concatenation. In this example you're concatenating several numbers together"
  
- Class: text
  Output: 'Notice that the assignment operator (<-), which consists of the two characters
    < (less than) and - (minus) occurring strictly side-by-side and it points to the
    object receiving the value of the expression. In most contexts the = operator can be used
    as an alternative'
  
- Class: text
  Output: 'Assignment can also be made using the function assign(). An equivalent way of making
  the same assignment as above is with: assign("income", c(10, 5, 3, 6, 21))'
  
- Class: text
  Output: 'The usual operator <- can be thought of as a short-cut to this'

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Create a numeric vector named gender which contains the number 1, 0, 1.
  CorrectAnswer: omnitest(correctExpr="gender <- c(1,0,1)")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="gender <- c(1,0,1)")
  Hint: 'Assign the numbers 1,0,1 to the a vector named gender; you could do that like this: gender <- c(1,0,1)'

- Class: text
  Output: 'For the curious ones, assignment can also be made in the opposite direction.
    So the same assignment could be made using c(10, 5, 3, 6, 21) -> income'
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: If an expression is written but not assigned a name, then the expression will not be saved.
    Type income, for example, to see what it contains. 
  CorrectAnswer: omnitest(correctExpr="income")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="income")
  Hint: 'Type income'
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, type c(10,5,3,6,21)
  CorrectAnswer: omnitest(correctExpr="c(10,5,3,6,21)")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="c(10,5,3,6,21)")
  Hint: 'Type c(10,5,3,6,21)'

- Class: text
  Output: 'You can actually see the numbers concatenated, but they werent saved to a vector/variable.
    In the case you wanted to see these numbers again you would have to type c(10,5,3,6,21) again and again'
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Now, a really important function is length(). I think the name is pretty explanatory.
    Try it out yourself, type: length(income)'
  CorrectAnswer: omnitest(correctExpr="length(income)")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="length(income)")
  Hint: 'Type length(income)'


- Class: mult_question
  Output: What do you think this number means?
  AnswerChoices: This variable has the number 5; 5 is the last number of income; income has 5 numbers
  CorrectAnswer: income has 5 numbers
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'income has 5 numbers')
  Hint: 'It is exactly what the function name means!'
  
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'So, to make it a bit more complicated, what do you think would be the length of this expression
    c(income, 0, income)? Try and think it logically before answering!'
  AnswerChoices: 10; 15; 11
  CorrectAnswer: 11
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= '11')
  Hint: "Was is the length if income? If we had income twice then it's twice the length plus the number zero"
  
- Class: text
  Output: "Besides numeric vectors, R handles character vectors, logical vectors and factors.
    I'll explain briefly each one"

- Class: text
  Output: Everything you've learned about numeric vectors can be applied to character vectors.
    With the exception that instead of numbers, character vectors can only contain "characters"
    
- Class: text
  Output: 'Did you notice that I included the characters word in " "? Any character in R needs
    to be surrounded in " ". R can handle words, sentences, or simply letters but R doesn't know when
    you're using words or letters which is why you need wrap your text with " "'

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Let's give it a try. Create a vector named myname and include your FIRST name inside it'
  CorrectAnswer: var_is_a('character', 'myname')
  AnswerTests: var_is_a('character', 'myname')
  Hint: 'Start off by the vector name: myname <- and now type your first name wrapped in ""'
  
- Class: text
  Output: 'Now, if you wanted to include your last name into that character vector, how would you
    do it? I can think of two ways. You create the myname vector again and using the c() you concatenate
    your first and last name. That was easy'
    
- Class: text
  Output: 'But what if your initial vector had hundreds of names,
    you wouldn't want to rewrite them all. What would you do in that case?'
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'A simpler and more elegant way would be to create a vector named myname which
    CONCATENATES the vector myname and your last name together. Remember, myname is not a character
    object but a character VECTOR, so you don't have to wrap it around with the " ". Try it out yourself'
  CorrectAnswer: val_has_length(2)
  AnswerTests: val_has_length(2)
  Hint: 'Start off by the vector name: myname <- and now open the c() and include, first the
    myname vector and then your last name wrapped in " "'
  
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'Now let's talk about logical vectors. I think logical vectors are quite intuitive.
    Remember that our income variable has the numbers 10,5,3,6 and 21 in its contents. If I would type income > 7,
    what do you think will be the correct equivalence?'
  AnswerChoices: TRUE, TRUE, TRUE ,TRUE, TRUE; FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE; TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE; FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE
  CorrectAnswer: TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE')
  Hint: 'Think of it this way: the condition is tested on each number separately. If the first
    number is higher than 7 then it will have a TRUE, and so on..'
  
- Class: text
  Output: 'Logical vectors can only contain either TRUE or FALSE. Moreover, ALWAYS, I repeat ALWAYS,
    TRUE represents a 1 and FALSE represents a 0. Just keep that in mind'

- Class: text
  Output: "To give you a brief example on how to use logical vectors, imagine that we assigned income > 7
    to a vector named logical. Every time we entered the name logical we would get TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE,
    TRUE. But what is that useful for? Those which have TRUE have income higher than 7 and those which have FALSE have
    income lower than 7. For those familiar with some statistical jargon, it's simply a dummy variable"
    
- Class: text
  Output: 'The last R object we need to talk about are factors. Factors are the variables on which you can
    store categorical and ordinal values. A categorical variable is when you have categories which have no
    particular order(like Married, Divorced, Single, etc). An ordinal variable are categories which do have
    a hierarchical order(like poor, improved, excelent)'
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Let's make an example. I already typed: diabetes <- c("Type1","Type2","Type1","Type1"), which creates
    a character vector of length 4. Now you type diabetes <- factor(diabetes)  Don't panic! We could read
    the expression as: take the vector diabetes, convert it into factor and save it with the name diabetes again'
  CorrectAnswer: omnitest(correctExpr="diabetes <- factor(diabetes)")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="diabetes <- factor(diabetes)")
  Hint: 'Type diabetes <- factor(diabetes)'
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Type diabetes to see its content'
  CorrectAnswer: omnitest(correctExpr="diabetes")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="diabetes")
  Hint: 'Type diabetes'
  
- Class: text
  Output: 'Notice the levels option. This option is telling you that this factor variable has two categories,
    namely Type1 and Type2. So far it doesn't say anything about the factors being ordered.
    Remember that we didn't assign any specific hierarchical order(as in an ordered variable) so the factor
    function ASSUMES that this is a categorical variable'
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'We could do it in a similar way, but adding more options: status2 <- factor(status, order = TRUE,
    levels=c(“Poor”, “Improved”, “Excellent”)). I went ahead and ran it myself. Type status2 to see the results'
  CorrectAnswer: omnitest(correctExpr="status2")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="status2")
  Hint: 'Type status2'
  
- Class: text
  Output: 'The only difference is that now the levels option actually specifies that poor is less than improved,
    and so on. Note that our initial vector had “Poor”, “Improved” and “Excelent” in our desired order.
    If the order would've been “Poor”,”Excellent” and “Improved”, how would have we specified the correct order?'

- Class: text
  Output: 'That's easy: with the levels option. Check out the expression: factor(status, order = TRUE, levels=c(“Poor”, “Improved”,
    “Excellent”)).  The levels option we use it to specify the ordinal order of our character vector'

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'We can check what type of vector we are working with by calling the function class(x) which takes
    as an argument the name of the vector we want to analyse. Try class(status2)'
  CorrectAnswer: omnitest(correctExpr="class(status2)")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="class(status2)")
  Hint: 'Type class(status2)'
  
- Class: text
  Output: 'Let's talk about sequences now'
  
- Class: text
  Output: 'R has a number of facilities for generating commonly used sequences of numbers.
    For example 1:30 is the vector c(1, 2, …, 29, 30). The construction 30:1 may be used
    to generate a sequence backwards'
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Try creating a numeric vector named oursequence containing a sequence from 1 to 9 using the semicolon(:)'
  CorrectAnswer: omnitest(correctExpr="oursequence <- 1:9")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="oursequence <- 1:9")
  Hint: 'Create a vector named oursequence which contains a sequence 1:9'
  
- Class: text
  Output: 'The function seq() is a more general facility for generating sequences. The first two
    arguments specify the beginning and end of the sequence, and if these are the only two arguments
    given, the result is the same as the colon operator. That is seq(2,10) is the same vector as 2:10'
  
- Class: text
  Output: 'Arguments to seq() can also be given in named form, in which case the order in which they
    appear is irrelevant. The first two arguments may be named from=value and to=value; thus seq(1,30),
    seq(from=1, to=30) and seq(to=30, from=1) are all the same as 1:30'
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'The next two arguments to seq() are named length=value and by=value, which specify the length
    and the jumps in the sequence. For example, type seq(1, 10, by= 2)'
  CorrectAnswer: omnitest(correctExpr="seq(1, 10, by= 2)")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="seq(1, 10, by= 2)")
  Hint: 'Type seq(1, 10, by= 2)'
  
- Class: text
  Output: 'The only difference from the previous sequence is that this sequence jumps every two numbers.
    If you don't specify the by argument, it has 1 by default'
    
- Class: text
  Output: 'A related function is rep() which can be used for repeting an object in various ways.
    The simplest form is rep(x, times=x) where x is either a number, a character, a logical or a vector
    of any of those forms'
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'Remember that our income vector has the numbers c(10, 5, 3, 6, 21) inside.
    If we typed rep(income,2) what do you think would be the result?'
  AnswerChoices: 10, 5, 3, 6, 21,10, 5, 3, 6, 21; 21, 6, 3, 5, 10, 10, 5, 3, 6, 21; 10, 5, 3, 6, 21, 21, 6, 3, 5, 10
  CorrectAnswer: 10, 5, 3, 6, 21,10, 5, 3, 6, 21
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= '10, 5, 3, 6, 21,10, 5, 3, 6, 21')
  Hint: 'The result would be the contents of the vector repeated twice'
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'That function is pretty straight forward. An additional option you can specify is the
    each option. Type rep(c(10, 5, 3, 6, 21), each=2)'
  CorrectAnswer: omnitest(correctExpr="rep(c(10, 5, 3, 6, 21), each=2)")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="rep(c(10, 5, 3, 6, 21), each=2)")
  Hint: 'Type rep(c(10, 5, 3, 6, 21), each=2)'
  
- Class: text
  Output: 'Also quite intuitive; it simply repeats each number twice. Remember that all these functions
  can be used with any vector(numeric,character, logical) and all of these expressions can be saved to a name'

- Class: text
  Output: 'Before concluding, let's go over arithmetic operations with vectors. When perform any arithmetic
  operation with vectors, the default for R is to carry the operation for the same position in the two different
  vectors. For example, c(1,2) + c(3,4) would equal c(4,6). So R compares the 1st object in the 1st vector
  to the 1st object in the 2nd vector, and so on..'
  
- Class: text
  Output: 'The same principle applies to subtraction, multiplication and division. It's pretty simple'
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: But what would happen if both vectors had different lengths? Try it yourself by adding
    c(1, 2, 3, 4) and c(0, 10). Don't worry about saving the result in a new variable.
  CorrectAnswer: c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10)')
  Hint: Enter c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10) in the console to see how R adds two vectors
    of different length. Don't assign the result to a variable.

- Class: text
  Output: If the length of the shorter vector does not divide evenly into the length
    of the longer vector, R will apply the 'recycling' method, but will throw
    a warning to let you know something fishy might be going on.

- Class: text
  Output: 'The recycling method simply repeats the shorter vector until it evens up with the longer vector'

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Try c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10, 100) for another example.
  CorrectAnswer: c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10, 100)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10, 100)')
  Hint: Type c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10, 100) to see how R handles adding two vectors,
    when the shorter vector's length does not divide evenly into the longer vector's
    length. Don't worry about assigning the result to a variable.
