## RonR! First Seminar Series

The RonR! Seminar Series is an interactive R course aimed at students who want to learn R. They were first created as a set of exercises for a series of lectures given in April-May 2016 in Pompeu Fabra University. These exercises have evolved to stand on their own and can now be accessed by following the tutorial [here](https://github.com/cimentadaj/Rseminars/tree/master/RonR_Second_Seminar).

**Seminar 1. An overview of the strengths of R**

*Note: This introduction does not contain exercises, only an [RMarkdown presentation](https://github.com/cimentadaj/Rseminars/blob/master/RonR_First_Seminar/First-seminar-presentation.rmd)*
