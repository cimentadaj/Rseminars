## RonR! First Seminar Series

The RonR! Seminar Series are a series of seminars that were taught at Pompeu Fabra University in April-May 2016. This repository contains all the R scripts, presentations and exercises used for each separate session. Anyone interested in using these exercises can download the swirl exercises from the session links.
