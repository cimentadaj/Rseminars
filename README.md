## RonR! First Seminar Series

The RonR! Seminar Series is an interactive R course aimed at students who want to learn R. They were first created as a set of exercises for a series of lectures given in April-May 2016 in Pompeu Fabra University. These exercises have evolved to stand on their own and can now be accessed by following the tutorial [here](https://github.com/cimentadaj/Rseminars/tree/master/Lesson_1).
