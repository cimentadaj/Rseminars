  Output: Hello! Welcome to the second lesson on data frames. 
    Before getting started, let's do a recap on what a data
    frame is and how it differs from matrices.

- Class: text
  Output: In a nutshell, a data frame is the typical data set
    you deal with in programs like SAS, SPSS, Excel and Stata.
    It has rows and columns where each column might be of a different
    nature (numeric, categorical, character). Matrices are different
    because all columns NECESSARILY have to be of the same
    category (numeric, categorical or character).

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Pretty much everything you've learned about matrices can be applied to data frame.
    There is however, another difference. Columns in data frames can be subsetted
    with the $ sign, whereas that's not possible for matrices. Which type of object in R
    can be subsetted using the $ operator?
  AnswerChoices: list; numeric; factor; matrix
  CorrectAnswer: list
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'list')
  Hint: Remember that the $ sign can be used when subsetting objects within a list!
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Based on your previous answer, then what would be the most appropriate definition
    of a data frame?
  AnswerChoices: 
    A data frame is used for storing variables of different classes;
    A data frame has list-columns for storing different class but equal length vectors;
    A data frame is an R object that necessarily contains various vectors and has the same properties as matrices;
    A data frame is has columns which should be of different classes and same length
  CorrectAnswer: A data frame has list-columns for storing different class but equal length vectors
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'A data frame has list-columns for storing different class but equal length vectors')
  Hint: The most complete definition specifies the list nature of the data frame and the class of its contents
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: If we had a data frame named ESS and within that data frame we had a
    column named gender, of all of these options, which one would not return an error?
  AnswerChoices: ESS[, gender]; ESS$gender; Gender
  CorrectAnswer: ESS$gender
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'ESS$gender')
  Hint: Remember that to subset a column using it's name you have to use the $ sign or use the [] and
    a character("") name inside it.

- Class: text
  Output: Let's see an example with the mtcars data frame. Suppose
    we're interested in calculating the mean of several columns.
    mtcars has several variables, but let's concentrate
    on the variables mpg and disp.
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: What would be the correct expression that will calculate the
    mean of the mpg variable?
  AnswerChoices: mean mpg; mean(mpg); mean(mtcars$mpg); mean mtcars(mpg); mean mtcars$mpg
  CorrectAnswer: mean(mtcars$mpg)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'mean(mtcars$mpg)')
  Hint: To calculate the mean of a variable you need to use the mean() function.
    Inside that function you specify the desired variable.
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now calculate the mean of the hp variable in the data frame
    mtcars
  CorrectAnswer: mean(mtcars$hp)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='mean(mtcars$hp)')
  Hint: To calculate the mean of a variable you need to use the mean() function.
    Inside that function you specify the desired variable.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: If we typed mtcars$hp, what class would the result be?
  AnswerChoices: list; data frame; numeric vector; matrix
  CorrectAnswer: numeric vector
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'numeric vector')
  Hint: Think about it differently, we calculated the mean of mtcars$hp. Of all of these classes,
    which ones can you calculate the mean from?
    
- Class: text
  Output: You can't calculate the mean of a list/data frame/matrix! You can calculate the mean
    of a numeric vector, which happens to be inside a data frame.

- Class: text
  Output: To continue, in order to calculate the mean of two variables then
    we would just repeat the function with another variable. For example,
    mean(mtcars$mpg) and mean(mtcars$hp). This is quite easy, but it would
    be a bit tiring repeating the name mtcars that many times. For that,
    we have the attach(), detach() and with() functions.
    
- Class: text
  Output: With the attach() and detach() functions you add the data frame
    as the momentary search path. This means that when a variable name is
    encountered, R will automatically search for it in the search path.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: First let's attach the data frame by typing attach(mtcars).
  CorrectAnswer: attach(mtcars)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='attach(mtcars)')
  Hint: Type attach(mtcars)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Now calculate the mean by typing: mean(mpg)'
  CorrectAnswer: mean(mpg)
  AnswerTests: expr_identical_to('mean(mpg)')
  Hint: Type mean(mpg)
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Try it for the hp variable'
  CorrectAnswer: mean(hp)
  AnswerTests: expr_identical_to('mean(hp)')
  Hint: Type mean(hp)

- Class: text
  Output: You get the mean for mpg and hp without having to write
    mtcars$ in front of the expression.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Now detach the data frame by typing detach(mtcars)'
  CorrectAnswer: detach(mtcars)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='detach(mtcars)')
  Hint: Type detach(mtcars)
  
- Class: text
  Output: The attach() and detach() functions are not entirely efficient
    when you're handling several datasets in R (something quite common).
    If you're interested 'in the explanation there's a debate going on here 
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10067680/why-is-it-not-advisable
    -to-use-attach-in-r-and-what-should-i-use-instead
    
- Class: text
  Output: 'What many R users recommend is using the with() function instead.
    The with() function does exactly the same as the attach and detach
    functions but in a different way. By writing with(mtcars, expression),
    instead of setting the data frame as a global search path, R will search for everything
    inside the expression in the mtcars data.'

- Class: text
  Output: 'To reproduce what we did with the attach function, one alternative is to use the
    with() function like this: with(mtcars, c(mean(mpg), mean(disp)))'
        
- Class: text
  Output: How would you read the expression? Take mtcars and calculate
    the mean of mpg and disp. You might ask yourself why did you have to wrap
    the two means with a c(). Basically, the with() function accepts an expression
    after the data, however, here we're actually calculating TWO
    expressions (two means) so we simply concatenate the two expressions into one.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Calculate the median of mpg using the with function. Hint:
    the median function is simply median().'
  CorrectAnswer: with(mtcars, median(mpg))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='with(mtcars, median(mpg))')
  Hint: 'The with functions takes the data frame as its first argument,
    and your expression as your second argument. So try with(mtcars,
    calculate the median of mpg)'
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now also calculate the mean of hp in the same expression.
  CorrectAnswer: with(mtcars, c(median(mpg), mean(hp)))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='with(mtcars, c(median(mpg), mean(hp)))')
  Hint: Type with(mtcars, c(median(mpg), mean(hp)))
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Please calculate the mean of the variable disp and save it as mean_disp
    inside the mtcars data (assign the new name like $newname)
  CorrectAnswer: mtcars$mean_disp <- with(mtcars, mean(disp))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='mtcars$mean_disp <- with(mtcars, mean(disp))')
  Hint: The structure should be something in the lines of; mydata$new_variable <-
    assignment of value
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Check the insides of mtcars with head(mtcars)
  CorrectAnswer: head(mtcars)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='head(mtcars)')
  Hint: Type head(mtcars).
  
- Class: text
  Output: See your mean_disp variable as the last column? Neat! 
    I think you might have a good idea how attach(), detach() and
    with() work. Let's move on to merging data frames.
  
- Class: text
  Output: Let's start with the merge command. If you have two different
    datasets with a common identification variable(something like unique ID,
    countries or school ID, etc..), then you merge them like this merge(dataframe1, 
    dataframe2, by="ID variable")
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: For this exercise I've created two data frames named dataset1 and dataset2.
    See the contents of dataset1 by typing dataset1.
  CorrectAnswer: dataset1
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='dataset1')
  Hint: Type dataset1
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now do the same for dataset2.
  CorrectAnswer: dataset2
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='dataset2')
  Hint: Type dataset2
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: If you noticed, both data frames have a similar unique variable named 'first'.
    We could match them easily with the merge command. Using this example, adapt it to
    merge dataset1 and dataset2, by using the common variable.
  CorrectAnswer: merge(dataset1, dataset2, by = "first")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='merge(dataset1, dataset2, by = "first")')
  Hint: Using the merge function, place both out datasets in the merge function and
    specify their common variable in the `by` option as a character string.
  
- Class: text
  Output: 'That was easy! What if you wanted to merge according to TWO common ID variables?
    A good example would be merging students within a school. Each school has a unique identifier
    and each student as well.'
    
- Class: mult_question
  Output: It's just as simple. You only have to CONCATENATE both variables.
    Theoretically, what would be the correct answer?
  AnswerChoices: 
    merge(dataframe1, dataframe2, by="schools" & "students");
    merge(dataframe1, dataframe2, by="schools & students");
    merge(dataframe1, dataframe2, by=c("schools") & c("students"));
    merge(dataframe1, dataframe2, by=c("schools", "students"))
  CorrectAnswer: merge(dataframe1, dataframe2, by=c("schools", "students"))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'merge(dataframe1, dataframe2, by=c("schools", "students"))')
  Hint: In order to have two variables together we need to use the c() function and place
    two character strings.
  
- Class: text
  Output: A similar scenario would be if you wanted to append rows
    instead of columns. If you had two datasets with the same columns,
    then you can write rbind(dataframe1, dataframe2). rbind stands for
    row bind.
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's try a brief example. I've created two data frames which have the same two variables.
    Try and append the rows of dataset3 to dataset4 using the previous example.
  CorrectAnswer: rbind(dataset3, dataset4)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='rbind(dataset3, dataset4)')
  Hint: Type rbind(dataset3, dataset4)
  
- Class: text
  Output: Note that the two data frames must have the same amount of variables,
    but they don't have to be in the same order; rbind takes care of
    matching each column. If one of the data frames has an additional
    variable, it won't work.
    
- Class: text
  Output: Alright, so now you know how to manage your data frames.
    Go show of your new skills with a dataset of your own!
